# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in MATLAB: uninformative error messages. The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws an error if the input is negative, but the error message is quite generic. The improved version in `bugSolution.m` provides a more descriptive error message, making debugging easier.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Run `bug.m` with a negative input value. 
2. Observe the generic error message.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.m` file provides an improved version of the function with a more descriptive error message.  This helps developers quickly understand the cause of the error.
